            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p n="1">1. Quaere. <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hether they have any other warrant to put themselves into those quaking and trembling Postures, then those generall parts of the word, which commend</hi> the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out salvation with feare and trembling, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling at the word, serving the Lord with fear, and rejoycing before him with trembling? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Whether this man who propounds these <hi>Quaeries,</hi> speake soberly or rashly, if not maliciously of that he understands not, when as he saith in his first <hi>Quaere,</hi> They put themselves into quaking and trembling postures? whereas it is a thing which they cannot avoid or fly from.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Quaere. <hi>Whether when holy trembling and feare is commended in the Scriptures, there be meant any other ordinarily, then the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and holy dread in the soul,</hi> to stand in aw of God, and repent before him, and walk humbly with the Lord?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Why dost thou put in the word <hi>Ordinarily?</hi> it seems thou thy selfe darest not exclude an extraordinary trembling to be comprehended in those Scriptures; and if it be comprehended at all in any of them, it is sufficient. If any of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Lord have been made to roar, and have been so shaken untill they have thought all their bones to be out of joynt, it is sufficient. If it was so with <hi>David,</hi> who was a strong one, and yet a type of the weak ones who should after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards arise (for its said, <hi>He that is weak, shall be as David, Zac.</hi> 12.8.) then it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not whether some Scriptures that name trembling, do or do not comprehend that sense ordinarily. Shall nothing fall out but what was ordinary, when as God hath some work, and strange work to bring to pass, whatever it is? Shall not the swords be beaten into Plow-shares? <hi>Isa</hi> 2.4. Shall not every Oak of <hi>Bashan,</hi> and Cedar of <hi>Lebanon,</hi> every one that is high &amp; lifted up, be brought low? <hi>Isa.</hi> 2.12, 13. Shall not all the Honourable of the earth be brought into contempt? <hi>Isa.</hi> 23.9. Shall not all the Idols of the Heathen be utterly abolished, when the Lord arises to shake terribly the earth? <hi>Isa.</hi> 2.18, 19. Shall not men cast all their Idols of silver, and Idols of gold to the Moles, and to the Bats, for fear of the Lord, and for the glory of his Majesty, when he arises to shake terribly the earth, <hi>ver.</hi> 20.21.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:191823:4"/>(which earth may comprehend the earthly, fleshly part of men for ought thou knowest) Are not these things foretold? Shall they not come to pass, seeing the Lord hath foretold them? And how shall they be ordinary, when they come to passe, seeing they seldome or never were before?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Quaere. <hi>Whether it were ordinary in the Old or New Testament, for the holy Servants of God to quake, be entranced, make strange noises, shew strange swellings and stirrings of the body, as if they were possest with some spirit?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Whether dost not thou render this work of God under as odious terms as thou canst, to enrage every one against them upon whom it falls? Why dost thou again put in the word <hi>Ordinary?</hi> If it were at all, I tell thee it is sufficient. Was not roaring and mourning like Doves strange noises? Was not <hi>Peter</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tranced, and <hi>Paul</hi> wrapt up, and <hi>John</hi> caught up in the Spirit higher and higher, to hear and see the Mysteries of God opened? and yet thou darest revile the dealings of the Lord with his servants.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Quaere. <hi>Whether if they will heap up all Scriptures that mention trembling and quaking, they may not put in this also,</hi> The Devils believe and tremble?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Whether this discover not a heart filled with maliciousness and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. And Secondly, whether this be not a contradiction to the Fourteenth <hi>Quaere?</hi> where thou sayest, they make nothing of the outward command of the Word.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Quaere. <hi>Whether the spirit that this people are led by, be a good spirit, because they are led into disorders? but Gods Spirit is a spirit of order.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Whether to assemble together in a peaceable, harmless way be disorder? Whether did Christ or any of the Apostles judge the flocking together of the people after truth to be disorder, though the World counted it a turning of all upside down?</p>
            <p n="6">6. Quaere. <hi>Whether they have not the Word of God as a shadow when they make it stand by at their pleasure? as when the man will leave the Wife, or Wife the Husband, to follow their Circumcellion walkes, and roving about?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Whether doth not Christ plainly put his servants sometimes upon forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all for his sake, Houses, Brethren, Sisters, Father, Mother, Wife, Children, Lands? <hi>Mat.</hi> 19 29. How do they make the word of God as a shadow in obeying the Lord herein? Dost not thou rather make it as a shadow in that thou sayest, but doest not? Dost not thou make it stand by at thy pleasure, untill thou satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie thy own will, in fulfilling the lusts of the flesh? And for the word <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellion,</hi> why dost thou use a dark word so improperly? which of them are Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house or Tavern haunters?</p>
            <p n="7">7. Quaere. <hi>Whether the Apostle is to be justified in saying,</hi> Let every one abide in his own calling, in so doing he abideth with God; <hi>or these parties are to be justified more, that leave their callings and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:191823:4"/>and take up the Trade of the spirit that runs about and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passeth the earth?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Whether the thousands of Beleevers spoken of in the Book of the Acts of the Apostles, did not abide in that calling wherewith they were called of God, and so abide with God, although they sold up what they had, and lived toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? And if these should doe so, whether doth this man know that they doe not abide in that calling to which they are called of God? And whether doe they who deny themselves of the pleasures, honors and riches of this world; or they that run to and fro to compasse them, take up the trade of that spirit that compasses the earth? And againe, whether that man that brings Scripture in his mouth to oppose therewith the practises and minde of them who write them, and thereby to keep off from self-deniall, and the crosse, be not a wrester of the Scriptures to his owne destruction?</p>
            <p n="8">8. Quaere. <hi>Whether they walk according to that rule,</hi> Whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ye would that men should do unto you, do you even so to them: <hi>when they leave their houses, sell up their goods, and make their creditours lose many and great debts, making no conscience of it to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud them, and leave them in the lurch?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Whether dost thou not rather break that Rule, <hi>Do as you would have others do to you,</hi> when thou wouldst enrage and stir up both People and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, and all to swallow them up, and make an end of them? <hi>Thou that say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est a man should not break that excellent Rule, dost thou break it?</hi> thou that wouldst not have others to speak lyes of thee, dost thou speak lyes of others? thou that judgest another, dost not thou condemne thy selfe, if thou be guilty of the same? But whether dost thou know any of them to make no conscience of defrauding their Creditors? I know but some of them, and I know that they do make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to discharge their debts to their power.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Quaere. <hi>Whether this wisdome of theirs be from Heaven, which is followed with this charity, to call all damned, and children of the Devil (whether they know them or know them not) that walk not their way?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> I cannot finde this to be true. But suppose some speak rashly, must that be clapt upon the backs of others that approve not of it? And if some do to say so some, whose hearts are discovered to them by their deeds and words, what want of charity is in it? and what want of heavenly wisdom, if it be spoken in due time, that is, when the spirit of the Lord shall pronounce it against a person by another? what want of charity or heavenly wisdom was in Christ, when he told the Jews, <hi>Ye are of your father the Devil, and the works of your father ye will do?</hi> or in <hi>Peter,</hi> when he said to <hi>Simon, Thou art in the gall of bitternesse, and bond of iniquity?</hi> or in <hi>Paul,</hi> when he said to <hi>Elymas, Thou child of the Devil, thou enemy of all righteousnesse? Acts</hi> 13.10. What further knowledge needed <hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>Peter</hi> of these persons, then a discovery of their spirits by their present words and actions?</p>
            <p n="10">10. Quaere. <hi>Whether they be not possessed with a higher and holier spirit then</hi> Paul, <hi>who gave</hi> Agrippa, Festus, <hi>and</hi> Felix <hi>their titles, being
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:191823:5"/>called before them, and behaved himselfe submissively and modestly; but these,</hi> Thou, <hi>revile and scorn fully contemn all Superiours and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Whether are all Magistrates to be honoured alike, and have titles of honour given them, seeing its made a Character of one who dwells in God, not to honour but contemn a vile person? <hi>Psal.</hi> 15 4. and seeing that <hi>Mordecai</hi> would not give honor to wicked <hi>Haman,</hi> although he was advanced by the King above all the Princes in the Land; and command was given by the King that he should be honoured; and the Kings servants pressed <hi>Mordecai</hi> daily with the Kings command, <hi>Esther</hi> 3.1, 2, 3. and seeing that Christ himselfe called <hi>Herod</hi> a Fox; and <hi>Paul</hi> called <hi>Ananias</hi> whited wall, because he gave order to smite him contrary to Law; and <hi>Stephen</hi> called the people and Rulers <hi>Uncireumcised in hearts and cares;</hi> which was as hatefull a terme to them as any could be. For what was more hatefull among them, then to say <hi>Uncircumcised?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, Although God rules in the Kingdome of men, and sets up over it the basest of men, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.17. yet whether are not these wicked Powers which rule by Will and Violence called <hi>Beasts</hi> in Scripture? <hi>Dan</hi> 7.3, 5, 7, 11, 12, 17. (the whole Chapter is worth the heeding) read also the 17. of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> where you may see the Beast called <hi>Scarlet coloured Beast,</hi> Verse 3.</p>
            <p>Againe, Whether did not <hi>Paul,</hi> and all the rest of the Disciples use the word <hi>Thou</hi> to all Magistrates, and all men, when they spake to one particularly? Yea, is it not the constant language used in the Scripture to one in particular? And if it should not be used in the English tongue, as well as in other Languages, why did not the Translators of the Bible put in You instead of Thou? Whether dost not thou who Quaeties use the word <hi>Thou</hi> to him who is higher then all Magistrates? If it be dishonour to Magistrates to be Thoued, why is it not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour to the Lord himselfe to be Thoued at every word?</p>
            <p n="11">11. Quaere. <hi>Whether the Nation of England, be not blinde of both eyes, when they do not see the designs of Satan by these, and such like instruments is to tread underfoot both Magistracy and Ministery?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> If the Nation of <hi>England</hi> be blinde of both eyes (that is wholly blinde) then whether is it not high time for them to remove their Teachers, who have got their moneys all this while, and yet have communicated no light to them, but left them altogether blinde, even of both eyes? But although the Nation of <hi>England</hi> be left blinde of both eyes by their Teachers; yet whether hath it not got some sparks of light some other way, and so much as may serve to let it see these things to be a designe of God against corrupted Magistrates, and corrupt and blinde Guides? You are blinde, and would make them blinde.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Quaere. <hi>Whether this be not the high way highly to offend and Grieve Gods spirit, to say, That standing naked on the top of a Crosse, in a Market-place, a mans lying naked, and a woman coming to lye with him, is commanded them by God, and by the spirit of God, that so they should doe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Whether <hi>Isaiahs</hi> being naked did grieve the spirit of God? <hi>Isa.</hi> 20.

                  <hi>Reply.</hi> Now consider, dost thou not here condemne that for confusion, which is order with God? even that which is set down <hi>Verse</hi> 30.31. <hi>If any thing be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to another that fitteth by, let the first hold his peace; for ye may all prophesic one by one, that all may learne, and all may be comforted:</hi> Is not this confusion in thy sight, though it be order with God? But tell me, O man, is not this rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, to invent or hold up ways of worship that have no correspondency with, or firme ground from the Scriptures? Was not this the very sin of <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> who offered up strange fire before the Lord, which he commanded them not, <hi>Lovit.</hi> 10.1. and therefore brought confusion upon themselves from the Lord, for confounding and mingling their own inventions with the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the Lord?</p>
               <p>And whereas its said, <hi>God is not the Author of confusion, but of peace:</hi> How canst thou take these words into thy mouth, when thou art preparing war against thy Brethren, and not peace? If thou wert his Son who is the Author of peace, thou wouldst be a peace-maker, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.9. and not a stirrer up of an unruly rage among the people against these who are peaceable, and do suffer patiently the abuses of ungodly men against them.</p>

                     <p>Let your women keepe silence in the Churches; for it is not permitted unto them to speak, but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the Law.</p>
                     <p>And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home; for it is a shame for women to speak in the Church.</p>

                  <hi>Reply.</hi> If this Scripture doth wholy exclude women from speaking at all meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; then what is the meaning of that <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.5. <hi>Every woman that prayeth or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesieth with her head uncovered, dishonoreth her head?</hi> Where are women to use their spirituall gifts, when they are given them? Daughters have the promise of the Spirit as well as Sons, and to prophesie as well as Sons; where shall they prophecy, if not in that place where the Power of the Spirit shall come upon them? Shall they prophesie to walls, or to people that shall be about them?</p>

                        <hi>Now we command you Brethren, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw your selves from every Brother that walketh disorderly, &amp; not after the tradition which he received of us.</hi>

                  <hi>Reply.</hi> Whether doth this Scripture bear an edge against a laborious people who love not idlenesse, as he would turne it? or whether doth it not fully and truly strike home at all idle Hirelings who walke disorderly, and not after the Tradition which is left by the Apostles; who worke not at all, but are busie-bodies, medling with that which they have nothing to doe with, so long as they hate to be reformed? <hi>Psal.</hi> 50.16, 17. from such we are commanded to withdraw; and they are commanded that with quietnesse they worke, and eate their owne bread, and not bread got by unquietnesse and Robbery: Yea, the Lord hath spoken it, and they shall be withdrawn from, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.10. <hi>Thus saith the Lord, I am against the Shopherds, and will require my flock at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the flock; neither shall the Shepherds feed themselves any more; for I will deliver my flock from their mouth, that they may not be meat for them.</hi>

               <head>Having now finished my Replyes to this mans <hi>Quaeres,</hi> and to those <hi>Scriptures</hi> as they are used, or rather abused by him: I shall now return a few <hi>Quaeres</hi> back againe.</head>
               <p n="1">1. Quaere. <hi>WHether the man that propounded the foregoing Quaeres against the People he calls Quakers, was acted by the Spirit that was in</hi> Paul, <hi>or by a contrary Spirit? because</hi> Paul <hi>saith,</hi> The weapons of our warfare are not carnall: <hi>But he cries aloud for the carnall weapons of the Magistrate to subdue them, though they be a peaceable harmlesse People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Qaere. <hi>If this people were tares ready to choak the wheat, yet whether doth not his counsell contradict the counsell of Christ,</hi> Mat. 13.29, 30. <hi>Where he saith,</hi> Let both grow together untill the Harvest, lest you pluck up the Wheat with them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Quaere. <hi>Whether</hi> Gamaliel <hi>or this man gave better counsell</hi> Act. 5.34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39. <hi>where</hi> Gamaliel <hi>said,</hi> Let them alone; if it be not of God it will come to nought; <hi>but this man saith, move the Magistrate to subdue them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Quaere. <hi>Whether this man who cannot heare the meetings of a
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:191823:10"/>peaceable harmlesse People at</hi> Malton <hi>in Yorkshire could have born the sight of such a multitude who hurried up and downe after Christ (if he had lived in those dayes) any better then the disdainfull Pharisees?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Quaere. <hi>Whether this man (seeing he wants</hi> Gamaliels <hi>patience) he not struck with fear, lest if this People be let alone, they will take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his place in the Nation &amp; his gain by their means shal be destroyed?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Quaere. <hi>Whether the Idols of the Nations, needing hoops of iron to fasten them in the walls, lest they fall, doe not represent and bear an affinitie to all Idoll Ministers, that are afraid to fall, except they be sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded and guarded with the power of the sword to uphold them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Quaere. <hi>Whether the Priests are worthy to stand any longer, if they cannot defend themselves and their callings by spirituall weapons alone, against a people who use no other weapons but spirituall?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. Quaere. Lastly, <hi>Suppose that there were some reall and true oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of stumbling given by some of them at</hi> Malton, <hi>or any where else: Suppose that some heresies should arise among some of them, as it came to passe in those Churches, called the Primitive Churches,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.19. <hi>Yet whether were it safe for thee to drown all under calumnies and reproach for these fews sake? Do not these People most resemble those who were called out of the world in those dayes of the Primitive Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, of any that have yet appeared? and how knowest thou, but that there may be a blessing among them, a seed that cannot be destroyed? And how darest thou utter such perverse things against them? Repent, O man, and declare unto all people, what thou hast done, and what folly hath proceeded out of thy mouth.</hi> He that falleth upon this stone shall be broken; but he upon whom it shall fall, it will grinde him to powder. Even so <hi>Amen.</hi>
